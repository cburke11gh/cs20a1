		<p>I grew up in Stamford, Connecticut. Stamford is one of the largest cities in Connecticut and is right next to New York City, which I had the pleasure of visiting more or less whenever I wanted to. One thing people don't expect about me, though, is how I also lived in a small village in Austria called <a href="https://mapcarta.com/35530508" target="_blank">Fr√∂sau</a>. My uncle and grandparents run an egg farm there and I spent most of my summers with them.</p>
		<p>Sometimes, my family would go on hikes on the Alpine Mountains around Styria. It's a serene mountain range and lots of fun to traverse. There are small restaurants/taverns around the mountains and we would often stop there for lunch. I've attached a photo below to show you how beautiful the Styrian Alps are:</p>
